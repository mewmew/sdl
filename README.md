This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and
subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

win
===

Package win provides the core functionality required for window creation,
drawing and event handling. The window events are defined in a dedicated package
located at:

- [github.com/mewmew/we][]

The library uses a small subset of the features provided by [SDL][libsdl]
version 2.0. Support for multiple windows has intentionally been left out to
simplify the API.
